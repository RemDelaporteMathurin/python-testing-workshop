# Python Testing Workshop

Why is testing so important? :point_down:

:white_check_mark: Improves code quality

:white_check_mark: Makes future development easier

:white_check_mark: Reduces development time

This workshop will teach you how to test your python code using pytest while ensuring a high code coverage.


## Getting started

1) Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2) Install pytest

```
pip install pytest-cov
```

3) [Fork this repo](https://github.com/RemDelaporteMathurin/python-testing-workshop/fork)

4) Clone your fork
```
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/python-testing-workshop
```

## Workshop tasks

| Tasks | Description |
|-|-|
| [Task 1 - Fundamentals of unit testing](https://github.com/RemDelaporteMathurin/python-testing-workshop/blob/main/tasks/task_1_fundamentals.ipynb) | Learn the fundamentals of code testing |
| [Task 2 - Catch bugs with tests](https://github.com/RemDelaporteMathurin/python-testing-workshop/blob/main/tasks/task_2_debugging.ipynb) | Use tests to debug your code! |
